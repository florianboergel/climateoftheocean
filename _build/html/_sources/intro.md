# Climate of the ocean

In this class you will get an introduction to fundamental processes of the climate system. On this website you will find interactive tutorials where we step by step build our own climate model. In the end we will use a comprehensive coupled ice-ocean model simulating the Baltic Sea.

## Lecture content 

- Fundamental processes of the climate system (greenhouse effect, radiation balance, climate sensitivity, stability and feedbacks)
- Basic methods of the analysis and modeling of the climate system with focus on the ocean
- Equations of motion of the large-scale circulation with focus on the ocean
- Coupled atmosphere–ocean–sea-ice models
- Spatial and temporal variability of the climate system
- Anthropogenic climate change and natural climate variability (externally and internally driven climate variability)
