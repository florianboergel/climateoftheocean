## 1) The observed global energy budget

In the last lecture you have been discussing the global energy budget.

The figure below shows the current best estimates of the global **annual mean** energy fluxes.

During this exercise series, we will try to build a simple climate model based on this energy budget. But before, we need to simplify this budget even more.

Our simple climate model can be conceptualized as:

> change in heat content = 
> 
> - $+$ absorbed solar radiation (energy from the Sun's rays)
> 
> - $-$ outgoing thermal radiation (i.e. blackbody cooling to space)
> 
> - $+$ human-caused greenhouse effect (trapped outgoing radiation)

where each of these is interpreted as an average over the entire globe (hence "zero-dimensional").

To make this simple conceptual model quantitative, we need a mathematical formulation for each of these four processes.
